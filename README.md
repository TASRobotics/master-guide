# RaidZero Programming Guides

This is a quick guide to get started for the programming team. However, not everything may be mentioned here, because we value the ability to problem solve and RTFM (Read The Manual). Therefore, when you encounter a problem, use your brain a bit before asking for help. Most of the details mentioned in this document are mentioned in the WPILib documentation website. Use this [site](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/index.html) if you need further information.
