# RaidZero Programming Guides

This is a quick guide to get started for the programming team. If you ever need help, there are a variety of online sources to check from. Googling is an essential skill in software engineering, almost as important as knowing how to write and setup code itself. If you can't find an online source that explains what you need or don't understand it, there is always [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [chief delphi](chiefdelphi.com), or if its urgent you can always ask. Most of the details mentioned in this document are mentioned in the WPILib documentation website. Use this [site](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/index.html) if you need further information.
